# todo iterate over detection results, save index, bbox each time object is seen
#   initiate object only the first time it is seen
#   make sure the object is sent to feature extraction logic only when detection confidence is high
#   to make sure comparison results will be valid
#   visualize every objects' bbox, id and similarity score for each frame


"""
1. detect image object ✅
2. detect objects in videos (only classes found in image) ✅
3. in the meantime, show detection results ✅
4. also, save the detections to a database ✅
5. after all is detected, extract features ✅
6. rank all extracted features ✅
7 show results ✅
"""

# done 3. extract objects features every few frames, saving the best result
# done 4. add performance and efficiency modes.
#  Performance: extract objects and compare them every 2-3 frames.
#  Efficiency: only extract and compare the object once.
